## Summary

Expression profiles were determined at the following timepoints and genenotypes:

## Meta-module network
Each node in the meta-network represents a module of highly co-expressed genes.  The meta-network is defined by correlations between module eigengenes and partitions modules into three distinct strongly connected module groups.
