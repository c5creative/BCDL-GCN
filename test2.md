## Network Files

Available below are subnetworks associated with the Beta Cell Transcriptome network. They come in three flavors:

1. Interactive subnetworks - view directly in your web browser
2. Cytoscape network files (.cyjs) with all genes - import into and view with Cytoscape
3. Cytoscape network files (.cyjs) with only transcription factors - import into and view with Cytoscape

## FAQs

### How do I load network files in Cytoscape?
> In order to load a network from a local file you can select File → Import → Network → File... Choose the correct file in the file chooser dialog and press Open. After you choose a network file, another dialog will pop up. Here, you can choose either to create a new network collection for the new network, or load the new network into an existing network collection. When you choose the latter, make sure to choose the right mapping column to map the new network to the existing network collection.

### Where can I get Cytoscape?
> You can download it [here](http://www.cytoscape.org/).
